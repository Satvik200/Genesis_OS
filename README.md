Genesis-OS: Building a Rust Kernel from Scratch
# What is Genesis-OS?

Genesis-OS is an ambitious project focused on creating a fully functional bare-metal operating system written in Rust. This project serves as a valuable learning resource for anyone interested in understanding the intricate workings of an operating system and the power of Rust for low-level development.

# What's the Project About?

Our journey dives deep into the core concepts of OS development, including:

- Kernel booting and initialization: Laying the foundation for the entire system.
- Memory management: Implementing paging, allocation, and protection mechanisms.
- Interrupt handling: Responding to hardware and software events efficiently.
- Device drivers: Interacting with physical hardware like VGA and keyboard.
- System calls: Providing user interaction and application support.
# Development Roadmap

We're committed to a clear and achievable development plan:

### Phase 1: Kernel Foundation :white_check_mark:

  - Minimal Rust kernel established to run on bare metal.
  - VGA buffer implemented for text output.
### Phase 2: Testing and Debugging :white_check_mark:

- Comprehensive unit and integration testing to ensure robustness.
- Debugging tools and strategies for efficient troubleshooting.
### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Upcoming)

- Interrupt handling to respond to hardware and software events.
- Memory management for efficient allocation and protection.
- Device drivers to interact with physical hardware.
### Phase 4: User Interface and Application Support (Future)

- Command-line interface for user interaction.
- Basic system utilities and applications.
